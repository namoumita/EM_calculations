# EM_calculations

This is the basic code that I initially drafted for my first journal paper titled, "Country level governance and earnings management: new evidence from North-European countries" which was published in International Journal of Work Innovation in 2022. 

The code attempts to calculate the level of Earnings Management by using proxies such as Jones Model(1995) absolute discretionary accruals and Kothari Model(2005).

The article regulated for country's governance policies and used indices from World Governance Index and Overall Index of Economic Freedom. 
The code shows how to manage for 6 indices and create aggregate index to help with the analysis. 

Apart from this the code demonstrates common descriptive statistics required to be presented in the paper therefore statistically describing the dataset at its best.
The code also shows Ordinary Least Square Methods - Fixed Effects calculations for panel data analysis.
After this I have also shown the codes for Feasible generalized least squares method- Fixed Effects as well as Two-Step System Generalised Method of Moments calculations.
I have used these two for robustness check which further supported the results.

Finally the NorthEurope file contains codes to push the outputs of the regressions in both MS Word and MS Excel. 
I have also included shortcuts to directly include statistical tests (Hausman, Sargan, etc.) along with the results. 

In case anyone is interested to know about my paper, I will link it here. Please understand that it's my first ever publication therefore it isn't that of an expert level.
